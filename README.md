# nba-injury-prediction
NBA Injury predictor. Research project for Human-Centered AI class. 

## How to run
In order to run the project, simply open the notebook `code.ipynb` and run everything. You can skip the section `READ DATA` because it performs pre-processes the raw data. As of right now, the code already fetches the pre-processed data `dataset_new_clean.csv`, so you can skip that section. You might need to install the `xgboost` and `shap` libraries, which can be installed with `pip install xgboost shap`.
